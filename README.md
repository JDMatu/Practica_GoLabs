# RAG Application with LangChain - Practical Examples

Welcome to the **Practica_GoLabs** repository! This repository contains all the practical examples developed during the **Specialty Practice** at **GoLabs**, where we explore the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications using the LangChain framework.

## üë• Team Members

This project is a collaborative effort from a group of talented individuals. The following team members are responsible for the development and success of this project:

- **Juan Diego Matute** 
- **Yovelky Delgado**
- **Carlo Luna** 
- **Jason Martinez** 
- **Andy Flores** 

## üåü Project Overview

The objective of this practice is to develop a series of practical examples showcasing the power of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** applications. RAG is a technique that enhances the capabilities of language models by retrieving relevant documents or pieces of information from external sources to generate more accurate and contextually rich responses.

**LangChain** is a powerful framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs) and external knowledge sources. Throughout this project, we will be leveraging LangChain to integrate various data sources and tools to create dynamic and highly efficient RAG-based applications.

## üîç Topics Covered

Throughout this repository, you will find examples and code snippets related to:

- **LangChain Basics**: Introduction to LangChain and its key components.
- **Document Retrieval**: Using external data sources to enhance language model responses.
- **Integration with APIs**: Connecting LangChain with APIs for real-time data.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques to optimize prompts for better LLM performance.
